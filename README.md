The manual consists of flat xhtml files which can be edited in any text or code editor to update and improve content.

It is recommended to view this manual locally, for example via a simple local webserver, to check how they render in a Web browser before committing. 

Currently changes to this repository are periodically manually deployed to the public website, and commits are not deployed automatically. 

PDF and epub versions of the manual are not automatically updated, this process is done separately via manual execution of scripts.
