</h1>
<p>In phpList you can organize your subscribers into <strong>lists</strong>. You must have at least one list, however, you may find that <strong>Segmenting</strong> your list further improves subscriber satisfaction (which is more motivating for you). There are several factors to be aware ofYou must select at least one list when sending</p><ul><li>You must select at least one list when sending</li><li>You can select several lists or use the <strong>all lists</strong>&#160;function when sending</li>
  <li>Subscribers will never get the same campaign twice, even if they are on several lists</li>
  <li>Lists can be further categorized to help you keep organized</li>
  <li>Lists are not the same as <strong>Attributes</strong></li>
</ul><h2>Go to your lists page
</h2>
<p>Go to <strong>Subscribers</strong> &gt; <strong>Subscriber lists</strong> from the main menu.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;<img src="static/creating_lists_in_phpList_1.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>This will take you to your Subscriber Lists page, where all of your lists will be displayed. There are two lists by default, <strong>test</strong> and <strong>newsletter</strong>. You can view lists by category, or view lists which have no category by selecting&#160;<strong>Uncategorized </strong>by using the dropdown menu. If you cannot see a list, check which category you are viewing.</p>

<h3>List Name
</h3>
<p>This will help you to keep your lists organized and remember what the list is for. If your list is public this name will be displayed on your subscribe pages.
  <br/></p>
<h3>Public List
</h3>
<p>The <strong>Public List</strong> box should be used when
</p>
<ul><li>You want subscribers to be able to add themselves to the list using a subscribe page</li>
  <li>You want subscribers to be able to leave the individual list (but stay on others).</li>
</ul><h3>Category
</h3>
<p>Categories can be used to help organise your lists: if you decide to use them there is lots of information in the categories chapter. You may not have any categories to choose from yet.</p><p/><ul><li>If you have no categories then no category dropdown on the page.</li><li>You <em>must</em> use categories if you have more than 16 lists, but you may wish to use them for just a few lists too.</li><li>If you have come categories already but you do not want to use them then simply leave this menu with&#160;<strong>--Choose category</strong>.</li></ul><p>In this instance I had already set up some categories and choose the category <strong>Gardening</strong> from the dropdown.</p>
<h3>List Description
  <br/></h3>
<p>This information will display on you subscribe pages if the list is public.
</p>
<h2>Save and repeat
  <br/></h2>
<p>When you have filled out the page click <strong>Save</strong>. You can always come back and edit the info again later if you need to.
</p>
<p>You can create a (theoretically) unlimited number of lists, but when you have more than 16 you will need to use categories.
