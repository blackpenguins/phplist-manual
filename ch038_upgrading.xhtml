</h1>
<p>No matter which way you choose to&#160; upgrade phpList, manually or via a web based installer, back up your database before starting any upgrade. Also backup any customised or altered file (eg: config/config.php, language inc files etc).
</p>
<h3>Auto Installer Upgrade.
</h3>
<p> Providing you have used your web based auto installer (Softaculous/Fantastico) to initially install your phpList you can simply update it by visiting the installers page and click on the upgrade link. NB: This will only appear when an update is available.

<p align="left">Simply click the green upgrade icon and let the system upgrade your installation. Once completed, simply restore your customised files and the upgrade is complete.
</p>
<h3 align="left">Manual Install Upgrade.
</h3>
<p align="left">To manually update phpList, do your backups as above PLUS make a backup of your entire lists directory, just in case, then download the latest versions from phpList, unpack the resulting ZIP or GZ file and upload the contents of the lists directory so as to overwrite your existing lists directory.
