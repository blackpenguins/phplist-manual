<p>The templating system in phpList is designed to create a workflow that keeps things simple for the campaign creator.
</p>
<h2>The Templating Workflow in phpList
  <br/></h2>
<p>There are two elements to the workflow:
</p>
<ol><li>Creating and uploading a template; this is done very rarely</li>
  <li>Choosing and using the template; this is done for every campaign</li>
</ol><p>Step one is the more complex and it is often done by a web designer or system administrator. We cover this in the creating a template chapter.&#160; There is also a really easy templates chapter to help you if you do not have a designer.
  <br/></p>
<p>The second part of the workflow is very simple. The person creating the campaign simply selects the template by name from a drop down menu after the campaign message has been written.
</p>
<p>The template is then applied during sending, like a wrapper around the text, and the person sending the campaign does not come into contact with the template code at all.
  <br/></p>
<p>The template is <em>not</em> applied to emails sent to subscribers who request a plain text email.
