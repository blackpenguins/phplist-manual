</h1>
<p>This chapter will explain how to export your contacts from Prestashop so they can be imported into phpList. First we will cover a basic export, then show how to match more complex information.
</p>
<p>Disclaimer: If you follow this chapter exactly it will import every person who has ever given their email to your store, whether or not they actually purchased from you, and even if it was several years ago. You will need to actively decide who to import and adjust your methods accordingly.&#160;
</p>
<h2>Exporting Contacts
</h2>
<p>First you need to export your contacts from phpList. You may have to do this in batches. first go to <strong>Customers</strong> &gt; <strong>Customers</strong> from the main menu. Select the largest possible number of customers in the small <strong>Display</strong> dropdown.
  <br/></p>

<p>&#160;Click the <strong>Export</strong> button
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/import_subscribers_from_prestashop_to_phpList_2.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p> and save the file as needed. If you wish to view the file you may be asked to select separator/deliminator options. Prestashop usually uses a comma. You can tell when you have chosen the correct option because the data will show in columns as you can see in the image below.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/import_subscribers_from_prestashop_to_phpList_3.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>&#160;</p><p><span>Importing into phpList</span></p>
<p>You should follow the section entitled "import by uploading a CSV file with emails and additional data" in the "adding&#160;subscribers&#160;to lists" chapter. The process&#160;beings&#160;with&#160;<strong>Subscribers</strong><span>&#160;&gt;</span><strong>&#160;Import emails</strong><span>&#160;and clicking the final button on the page.</span></p><p><img src="static/import_subscribers_from_prestashop_to_phpList_4.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>When you get to the&#160;<strong>Import Subscribers From CSV Page</strong>&#160;in the process you must;</p><p/><ul><li>click Browse and find the file you exported from Prestashop earlier</li><li>add a <strong>,</strong> (comma) as the deliminator</li></ul><p><img src="static/import_subscribers_from_prestashop_to_phpList_6.png" alt=""/></p><p>  From this stage you can follow the adding subscribers procedure exactly as described in the rest of that chapter.
</p>
<h2>Using the foreign key
</h2>
<p>If you want to use your prestashop ID as a <strong>Foreign Key</strong> in phpList, you must edit your prestashop export data first. </p><p>When you open the file for the first time your spreadsheet software, in this instance we used Libreoffice Calc, you need to specify the delimator. The data from Prestashop is separated using a semicolon by default.&#160;</p>
<p> In this case, ticking the <strong>Tab</strong>, <strong>Comma</strong> and <strong>Semicolon</strong> boxes produced the correct layout of the data in the preview pane, allowing <strong>Last Name</strong>, <strong>First Name</strong> and <strong>Email address</strong> to be in separate columns.
</p>
<p><img src="static/export_customer_emails_from_prestashop_2.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>You need to rename the column<strong> ID</strong> to something else, for example <strong>PrestashopID</strong>, because ID is a phpList function (correct word) and data in this column will otherwise be ignored.
</p>
<p><img src="static/change_col_name.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Then, when you import your data (following the import chapter) you may select PrestashopID as a <strong>Foreign Key. </strong>This means that each time you re-import data from your store, the subscriber details can be matched up using the key, so, for example, if a customer changes their email address in your store then the email will also be changed in phpList.
  <br/></p>
<h2>Segmenting lists based on Prestashop data
  <br/></h2>
<p> You may wish to segment your lists based on the subscribers behaviour in Prestashop - for example, by which Product Category they have purchased from, or if they have recently abandoned a cart.
</p>
<p>It is possible to export data for list segmentation using the Prestashop SQL exporter, however this requires knowledge of SQL. There are also some paid for plugins to do a similar task.
