</h1>
<p>When you have more than a handful of lists you will need to organize them into categories. You will be promoted to do this while adding lists, once you create more than 16 lists.
</p>
<p>You can create categories to help you organize your lists at any time, however, the exact method you should use depends on your situation. In this chapter there are two suggested workflows.
</p>
<ol><li>Categories are set up before any lists are made (<strong>categories before lists</strong>),</li>
  <li>Categories are set up to help organize pre-exisitng lists (<strong>lists before categories</strong>).
  <br/></li>
  </ol>You should follow the section most appropriate to your situation.&#160;<br/><ol/><h1>Categories before lists
</h1>
<p>To create your categories go to <strong>Config</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>
</p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_footer_menu.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>Scroll down until you find <strong>Segmentation settings</strong>.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/phpList_config_segementation_settings_1.png" alt=""/>&#160;
</p>
<p>Enter the names of your categories, separated by a comma.
</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/phpList_config_segementation_settings_2.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>So, in the example above I have made a list category called <strong>veganism</strong>.
</p>
<p>This is because I know I will have several lists about veganism in the future, for example, recipes, campaigning, events and philosophy. NEXT, See the section about <strong>Using categories </strong>at the bottom of the page.
  <br/></p>
<h1>Lists before categories
</h1>
<p>If you use phpList a lot and you are thorough in your list segmentation you will soon end up with more lists than you can easily manage without categorizing. To start categorizing your lists go to<strong>&#160;Subscribers&#160;</strong>&gt;&#160;<strong>Subscriber lists.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_lots_of_lists.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Then click&#160;<strong>Categorise lists</strong>.&#160;</p><p><img src="static/phpList_categorise_lists_1.png" alt=""/>&#160;</p>
<h2>Configure lists
</h2>
<p>If you have no lists at all you will see the following screen:
</p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_categorise_lists_2.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>
  <br/>Click <strong>Configure categories</strong>. If you already have a few categories you will see another screen with the <strong>Configure categories</strong> button (which you still must click) in the top right.
  <br/></p>
<p>Then, add your categories, one by one, with commas between them.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_categorise_lists_4.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.
</p>
<h2>Add lists to categories
  <br/></h2>
<p>Then go back to <strong>Subscribers</strong> &gt; <strong>Subscriber lists</strong>. Click the <strong>Categories lists</strong> button.</p><p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/phpList_categorise_lists_1.png" alt=""/></p><p>If you see some lists to categories, select the correct category from the drop-down beside each list.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_categorise_lists_5.png" alt=""/><br/></p>
<p>Carry on till all the lists are matched with a category if possible.
  <br/></p>
<p><img src="static/phpList_categorise_lists_6.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>If you find a list that does not fit into a category you can either leave it in <strong>Uncategorized</strong> by leaving <strong>-- Choose category</strong> in the dropdown or make a note to create another category after saving.&#160;</p><p><em>Note: if a list has already been categorised and you want to change the category, you can do this by editing the list from the main lists page.</em></p>
<p>When you have finished click <strong>Save</strong>, then if you want to create more categories click the <strong>Configure categories</strong> button at the top of the page and repeat the cycle.
  <br/></p>
<h1>Using your categories
</h1>
<p>Once you have finished setting up categories, the should become part of your everyday workflow with phpList.</p><p>For example, when you create a new list, you can assign it to a category. In this image I have created a list called Vegan Recipies I can categorize it under veganism.&#160;</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/phpList_config_segementation_settings_3.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Also, as a second example of categories in use; when you send a campaign you can look for your lists by using categories.</p><p><img src="static/sending_categories.png" alt=""/>&#160;</p>
