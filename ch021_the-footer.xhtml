</h1>
<p>The phpList footer
</p>
<ul><li>Is an active feature of the software, not simply a description of a design element</li>
  <li>Can be edited for each campaign from the content tab of the campaign workflow
  <br/></li>
  <li>Is replaced by a secondary footer when the Forward to a Friend system is used</li>
  <li>Should contain the [UNSUBSCRIBE] placeholder
  <br/></li>
  <li>Is placed in the template with the [FOOTER] placeholder</li>
</ul><h2>What is the footer?
</h2>
<p>In your template design you may have many elements which you think of as being "the footer." In the image below, for example, the blue and black coloured areas and all the content within them would commonly be described as the "footer."
</p>
<p>However, only the "update your preferences" and "unsubscribe" elements are within the phpList footer system. The rest is in the template itself.

</p>
<p><strong>When the forward to a friend system is used </strong>
</p><strong> </strong>
<p><strong>&#160; </strong>
</p><strong>Two footers or one? </strong>
<br/><p>If you use the [FORWARD] placeholder in your template or campaigns you will need to either create two footers or keep only the most basic information in the footer area. &#160;
</p>
<p>The footer should contain only the most basic elements and most of the usual footer style elements should be part of the main template. This is because the footer is replaced in certain situations with a secondary footer.&#160;
</p>
<h2>Your template footer
</h2>
<p>You can also create a footer as part of your template.&#160; This is added to phpList in a different way, because it is editable from the campaign creation page.
</p>
<p>To add a custom footer to your campaign use the [FOOTER] placeholder in your template,
</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/footer_1.png" alt="the [footer] placeholder" height="159" width="233"/>&#160;
</p>
<p>You should design your footer as a separate .html file
</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/footer_2.png" alt="creating a footer for phpList" height="517" width="490"/>&#160;
</p>
<p>To add your footer to phpList go to&#160;<strong>Config</strong>&#160;&gt;&#160;<strong>Settings</strong>&#160;and&#160;<strong>campaign settings</strong>
</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/config_settings_templates.png" alt="adding a default footer to phpList" height="300" width="557"/>&#160;
</p>
<p>Find&#160;<strong>Default footer for sending a campaign</strong>&#160;then click the edit icon
</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/footer_3.png" alt="edit default footer phpList" height="363" width="515"/>&#160;
</p>
<p>Paste in your footer code and click&#160;<strong>Save changes</strong>.&#160;
</p>
<p><img src="/phplist/_edit/static/footer_4.png" alt="save changes to default footer" height="264" width="501"/>&#160;
</p>
<p>Your footer will now appear in the footer section of the content tab in your campaign workflow, where you can tweak it.

</p>
<p>As well as in your campaigns when you send them
