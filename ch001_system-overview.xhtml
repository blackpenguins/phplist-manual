</h1>
<p>Welcome to the phpList Manual.
</p>
<p>This first chapter will explain what phpList is used for and give you a basic overview of how it works.
</p>
<h2>What is phpList?
</h2>
<p>phpList is used for sending email newsletters, announcements and notifications.&#160;<span>It is designed to send a single message (a<strong> campaign</strong>), by email to large numbers of&#160;</span>recipients<span>&#160;(<strong>subscribers</strong>).</span>
</p>
<p><span/><span>You organise your subscribers into <strong>lists</strong> and you can import email addresses&#160;from your email account, online shop, blog or database. You can also import&#160;</span><strong>attribute</strong><span>&#160;data, for example, subscriber name, city or shoe size.</span>
</p>
<p>Campaigns are composed in a web interface and can be <strong>personalised</strong> for each subscriber. Personalisation is done with the use of&#160;placeholders&#160;which display attribute data within the text of the emails, as well as unique links that <strong>allow subscribers to join or leave</strong> lists easily. You can use plain text, HTML and templates.
</p>
<p>Once a campaign has been sent, phpList will show <strong>statistics</strong> about it. This will include <strong>opens/views</strong> (who read the campaign), <strong>clicks</strong> (who clicked which link in the campaign) and <strong>bounces</strong> (which addresses were incorrect and delivery failed). Bounced mails and unsubscribes are automatically removed from the system, which will benefit future <strong>delivery of campaigns</strong>.
  <br/></p>
<p><span>phpList is&#160;</span><span>Open Source software and it is published under the GPLv2 licence.&#160;</span><span>You can install and host phpList on your own servers or you&#160;</span><span>can use it via the phpList Hosted service.</span>
</p>

<h2>What is Open Source?&#160;
</h2>
<p><span>Open Source, or "Free Software", </span><span><span>means that the original programming code is made freely available and may be modified.</span></span><span> In practice this means that&#160;phpList is very adaptable, easy to change and improve. </span><span>Open Source development relies on communities of users contributing to the project they use. You pay nothing for the software, but you are encouraged to collaborate with</span><span> the project though contributing code and/or though bug reports, translations, documentation, spreading the word and if you feel it has enriched your life, you can even donate!</span>
</p>
<p><span>What is phpList Hosted?</span>
</p>
<p><span>The phpList Hosted service is the cheapest way to have a fully working installation without having to worry about servers, blacklisting, bounces and deliverability.&#160; We manage the day to day maintainance of the software including updates and security.</span>
</p>
<p><span>Using our Hosted service is a great way to support the future development of phpList.</span>
</p><span>What does phpList not do?&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span>
<p><span>phpList is a one-to-many email program. It cannot easily be used to have "email conversations" many-to-many as you might do on software such as mailman.</span>
